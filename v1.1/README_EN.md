# UltraSonic Design Based on FPGA
This is a very simple example of a design. In fact, there are some very good projects in this category. So the project is only used as a demonstration.<br><br>
**Development platform**: *Windows11 21H2*, *Vivado 2018.2*
## Comparison of ultrasonic ranging systems built by the microcontroller and FPGA
FPGA are a type of programmable logic device that has developed rapidly in recent years, and it still has very clear prospects. Structurally, it consists of logical function blocks arranged in arrays and connected by programmable internal wiring. Its function is determined by the configuration data of the logical structure and can be programmed by modifying the routing of one or more internal wirings. Typical ultrasonic ranging system design, both can use the microcontroller platform, can also use the FPGA platform, here is some of the combing of the TWO: <br>
